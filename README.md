# React & Firebase Stack Template
I have created this standard template since the React & Firebase stack has been my go-to for all of my personal projects. Hopefully it will save you some time setting up! This template is based on Firebase Realtime Databases.

### Firebase credentials
In order to add your Firebase credentials:
1. `touch .env`
2. Open the .env
3. Copy the following:

``` 
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= 
```
4. Append your credentials.

Then it's just a simple case of `npm run start` and you can start working!
